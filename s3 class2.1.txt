Versioning :

1. If you delete an object from S3 it will be permanently deleted and we can’t restore it.
2. Versioning by default is disabled.
3. Versioning is used to prevent the accidental deletion of the data. Even if you delete an
object, we can still restore it.
4. Once versioning is enabled we can’t disable it. However we can suspend it. (FAQ)
a. To maintain a unique version ID of the object.
b. To avoid duplication of the same object.
5. We can enable versioning for the whole bucket and not for an individual object.
